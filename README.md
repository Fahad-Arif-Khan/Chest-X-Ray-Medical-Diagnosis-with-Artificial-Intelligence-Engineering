# Chest-X-Ray-Medical-Diagnosis-with-Artificial-Intelligence-Engineering
## build a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras
## Steps:-
### Pre-processed a real-world X-ray dataset
### Usedtransfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
### handled class imbalance
### Measureed diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
### Visualized model activity using GradCAMs
